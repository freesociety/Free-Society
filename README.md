# [Free Society](https://freesociety.org.uk)

## A free and open community based exchange of items, services and ideas

### Exchange

Offer and get items (e.g. fridges, books) and services (e.g. computer repair or cleaning) without the use of money.

### Forum

Talk about what you want only with who you want. Visibility of posts and the rules of the forum and exchange are determined by vote.

### Societies

Find societies and members and the related forums and information they have chosen to make available to you.

### Privacy (and Freedom)

You choose who views your posts. Other than this, no information about you of any kind is readable by anyone (including anyone running servers).

### Decentralisation

Decentralised administration (actions taken by vote). Decentralised database running on decentralised servers.

### Usability

Usable by anyone with access to a web browser (Firefox, Chrome etc.)

### No advertising or fees

### Code, Development & Copyright

Code released under the GPL. Development ongoing - help out if you can.

### Exchange

The structure of the exchange, as well as a karma-like point system, is used to encourage exchange within communities and additionally make it easier for members and societies who give more to in turn receive more. Points are created/destroyed (in a decentralised manner) so that as far as possible

*   valuable exchanges are encouraged and conversely activity for the sake of activity is not
*   roughly equal services received/given over a longer period of time is encouraged, while short term changes in the ratio are smoothed out
*   there are automatically enough points available for the amount of activity actually taking place
*   long term distribution of points maximises the number of useful exchanges
*   short term changes in overall activity are automatically compensated for i.e. smoothed out

A separate rating system helps to ensure the quality of goods and services. User-generated categories flexibily standardise items and services which aims to increase the efficiency of finding, comparing and producing these while limiting the impact of false signals (e.g. flashy advertising for a bad product).

There is the structure to develop a distributed, pseudonymous postal system which will help to solve the last mile problem by having people in each community (chosen by the community) who can accept items for others. We expect more traditional methods to be used at first however since any postal system depends on a large number of people using it to be efficient.

### Forum

The forum is flexible allowing members or societies to post whatever they want only to who they want to post it to. There will be an up/downvote system similar to Reddit and other sites which will determine the visibility of posts both in the subforum where they are posted and if popular enough make them more visible to users outside of the subforum (if allowed by the poster).

All unique accounts are by default "admins" i.e. they can attempt all actions which are confirmed by vote. It will however be possible for societies on creation to either choose the open method or to assign admins.

Rules for use of the exchange and forum will be created by members in a subforum. Members can request changes, deletions or additions to the rules and vote on these. Importantly members will only be able to vote on rules that affect them, this means that decisions are made by the people most involved and members do not get overloaded with information they don't need, as well as allowing for different rules in different locations or in different societies. Members of a community choose for themselves what are the most important issues to be discussed and only these issues are discussed by a wider group. The rules for changing the rules can themselves be changed by members.

### Societies

The societies section provides a convenient way to find societies and members, their related forums and information that they have chosen to make available to you.

### Privacy (and Freedom)

The servers never have access to any of the member's information (except what members deliberately set public). All information is encrypted before it leaves the member's computer/phone, and unlike normal https cannot be read by the server but only by those members that have been given permission to read it. Members are pseudonymous but we try to make sure that a person has only one unique account without relying on any central authorities (e.g. government-issued passports etc.) and in a natural and unobtrusive way. Societies or members will be able to run their own server and join the DHT (distributed database) on which all exchange, forum and member information is stored.

Privacy also means freedom since if you know your communications are being monitored you are not free to say or do what you want. However all posts must follow the rules decided by fellow members, and since only one unique account is allowed per person your comments will be remembered by those who you have given access to read them.

We will also use the fact that we are transmitting only small amounts of information to enhance the privacy of members. By transmitting lots of fake messages along with the real messages (possible because the real messages are small and infrequent) we aim to prevent the source of any message from being determined by a global passive adversary (i.e. GCHQ or the NSA). We also want the option to run a server without it being able to be identified as a server, so that members can connect without it even being known that they are using the service (by a webmaster adding a module to their existing website which hides small messages in the existing content). None of these methods have any effect on legitimate policing (since it is only designed to stop mass surveillance not targeted surveillance where a suspect's computer/phone could be compromised). Since only text can be posted we don't have to worry about dodgy stuff being posted (of course some text could be regarded as dodgy but we leave the rules regarding that for members to decide).

### Decentralisation

All users are admins (at least of the main forum). There will be no central servers (at least when people start running their own servers). The database containing all posts and exchange data will be distributed across all servers (which can be run by members or societies). Decision making and even the structure of the system to make those decisions is decided by members.

### Usability

We have rated usability very highly i.e. we want the website(s) to be usable by anyone capable of getting there in the first place. This also means we don't want to have to ask members to install anything at all (unless they want to run a server) or presume that they have any programs (e.g. java) other than their web browser installed. Frankly this means we have had to make design choices we would never otherwise have made, but believe that these are worthwhile to allow universal use. In fact we have tried as far as possible to make this a system that could be implemented without the use of computers - it is much quicker with them though.

### No Advertising, No Fees

There will not be any adverts since we don't like them and believe they can be a security or privacy risk. We are not so into irony that we would charge fees for a free society (although free here mainly means the freedom to use, change or modify as you want). We are not associated with any other web site or organisation with similar names. We recommend not paying for something that is supposed to provide freedom.

### Code, Development & Copyright

Some parts of the (frontend) code are on github. This is mainly useful for getting an idea of the graphical design and look, although we will likely use github more in the future, particularly since we would soon like more developers to get involved. The code is released under the GPL. Any of the content or ideas in this description page may be used in your projects as long as you make clear which modifications (if any) have been made, credit is given and no money is gained from this use (even indirectly e.g. through adverts).
